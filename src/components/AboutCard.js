                    <p>
                        First, thank you for visiting my webpage. I am a Full
                        Stack web developer with deep hands-on experience in
                        datacenter systems engineering and working
                        simultaneously with multiple software development teams.
                        As a datacenter internal support engineer at EMC, I
                        generated consistent praise for processing and closing
                        high ticket volumes with excellent customer satisfaction
                        in a fast-paced constantly changing environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recently certified in Full Stack Web Development from
                        the University of North Carolina, I acquired skills in
                        JavaScript, Node, React, CSS, Bootstrap and responsive
                        web design. I am a creative resilient problem solver
                        with a lifelong interest in coding, always seeking to
                        learn something new and to exceed my capabilities while
                        enhancing my innate talents. With each project, my
                        method is to code and test intuitive designs that are
                        based on a thorough analysis of the customerâ€™s
                        requirements.

                    <p>
                        I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a
                        recent project where I worked on a four person team to
                        develop a multiple page MERN app that helps video gamers
                        track the latest game releases, get gaming news, and
                        look up information for specific games.{" "}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am open minded to learning about new opportunities.
                        Looking forward to utilizing my unique perspective and
                        skillset in the future with a passionate quality-driven
                        team that works together to create a better customer
                        experience and a successful profitable company. Please
